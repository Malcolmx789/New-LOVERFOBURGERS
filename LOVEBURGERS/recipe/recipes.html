        <h2>Classic Cheese Burger</h2>

        <div class="instructions" id="toggleBtn1">
        <p>
          <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            In a large bowl, mix ground beef, onion powder, salt and pepper
          until just combined. Do not overmix, or your patties will be tough.
          <br />
          <h3>Step 2:</h3>
             Divide into six portions and form patties, without pressing too
          hard. They should be uniform in thickness. Smooth out any cracks using
          your fingers. Make these right before you grill them, so they stay at
          room temperature. <br />
          <h3>Step 3:</h3>
              Preheat your grill, grill pan or cast-iron skillet to high heat and
          add burger patties. If using a grill, cover with the lid. <br />
          <h3>Step 4:</h3>
              Cook until the crust that forms on the bottom of the burger
          releases it from the pan or grate — about 2 minutes. Gently test, but
          don't flip it until it gets to this point. When burgers lift up
          easily, flip, add two slices of cheese to each, close lid if using a
          grill, and cook on the other side for another 2-3 minutes for medium
          to medium rare. <br />
          <h3>Step 5:</h3>
          5. Remove burgers with a sturdy metal spatula and transfer to a plate.
          Allow to rest for several minutes, then transfer to buns. <br />
          <h3>Step 6:</h3>
          6. Garnish as desired and serve immediately.

          <h3>Step 1:</h3>
          In a small bowl, combine the sambal with the mayonnaise and ketchup and mix well. <br>
          <h3>Step 2:</h3>
          Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Grill the bacon over moderate heat, turning, until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes total. Drain on paper towels.<br>
          <h3>Step 3:</h3>
          Form the beef into eight 1/4-inch-thick burgers and season with salt. Grill over high heat, turning, until browned, 1 minute per side. Make 4 stacks of 2 burgers each on the grill and spoon 1 tablespoon of the sambal mayo over each stack. Top with the cheese, cover and grill over high heat just until the cheese is melted, about 1. <br>
          <h3>Step 4:</h3>
          Spread the remaining sambal mayo on the bottom buns. Top with the burgers, bacon and kimchi, close and serve.

        <div class="instructions" id="toggleBtn2">
        <p>
          <h3>Step 1:</h3>
          Preheat oven to 400°F. Bring 4 cups water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high. Add barley and bay leaf; return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, undisturbed, until barley is al dente, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain well, and transfer to a large bowl; remove and discard bay leaf. Let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. <br>
          <h3>Step 2:</h3>
          While barley cooks, toss together mushrooms, tamari, 2 tablespoons oil, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt on a large rimmed baking sheet; spread in an even layer. Place garlic head halves on a sheet of aluminum foil, and drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil. Tightly wrap foil around garlic, and place on baking sheet next to mushrooms. Roast in preheated oven until mushrooms are browned and beginning to dry out, about 40 minutes, stirring twice during cook time. Remove from oven; let cool on baking sheet 10 minutes. (Do not turn oven off.) Remove and discard foil from garlic; squeeze garlic cloves from skins, and set aside. Discard garlic skins.<br>
          <h3>Step 3:</h3>
          3. Transfer cooled barley to a food processor; pulse until roughly chopped, about 15 pulses. Transfer to a large bowl; add carrots, beets, cumin, and paprika. Transfer roasted mushrooms to food processor; pulse until finely chopped, about 10 pulses. Transfer mushrooms to barley mixture. Add chickpeas to food processor; pulse until roughly chopped, about 10 pulses. Transfer 1 cup chopped chickpeas to barley mixture. Add roasted garlic cloves to remaining chickpeas in food processor; process until smooth, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer chickpea-garlic mixture to barley mixture. <br>
          <h3>Step 4:</h3>
          Add panko, walnuts, and mustard to barley mixture, and stir until well combined. Shape mixture into 8 (1/2-inch-thick) patties (about 1/2 cup each). <br>
          <h3>Step 5:</h3>
          Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium. Add 4 patties; cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer seared patties to a large baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and remaining 4 patties. Bake patties at 400°F until tops and sides are crispy, about 10 minutes. Serve on buns with mayonnaise, lettuce, pickles, red onion, tomato, and vegan cheese, if desired.
